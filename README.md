# R-D

This project has been made for our R&D project, which was based on Exploit Development. In an XSS attack, the attacker aims to execute malicious scripts in a web browser of the victim by including malicious code in a legitimate web page or web application. The actual attack occurs when the victim visits the web page or web application that executes the malicious code. The web page or web application becomes a vehicle to deliver the malicious script to the userâ€™s browser. Vulnerable vehicles that are commonly used for Cross-site Scripting attacks are forums, message boards, and web pages that allow comments.

The entire working of our project is divided into 3 broad categories. The first category is for the detection of malicious websites using ML models. The second category is to check whether the website is exploitable or not using payloads after scraping the website using Python. The third category is where the vulnerabilities are actually exploited using specially crafted URLs with the injection of Javascript codes.
